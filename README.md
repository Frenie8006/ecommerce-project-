# ðŸ›’ Shopping Cart Application

## Description

Build a simplified e-commerce platform where users can:

- Browse products
- Add items to a cart
- Proceed to checkout

## Key Features

- **Navigation**: Use `react-router-dom` for navigating between pages like Home, Product Details, Cart, and Checkout.
- **State Management**: Implement `useReducer` to manage cart state (e.g., adding/removing items, updating quantities).
- **Global State**: Utilize the Context API to provide cart state and dispatch functions across components.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gain an understanding of managing complex state transitions with `useReducer`.
- Practice combining `useReducer` with Context API for global state management.
